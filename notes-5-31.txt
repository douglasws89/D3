Left align text in tooltip, right align numbers
We should probably just view one type of data for the map, tooltip, and comparison bar charts (DISCUSS WITH TEAM)

Parts I need to change in order to implement gender/age stuff:

Change colors to represent Gender, age, etc.
    Probably need to have values in dropdown menu be the same as their names in the JSON file
    
Change tooltip so that it shows how many of that gender/age/etc.
